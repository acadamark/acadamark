# Progress!!
With help from chatGPT I make some huge steps. 

https://github.com/abalter/academark-tags

What works (see example below):

- Hierarchy of sections `article` > `section` > `sub-section` > `sub-sub-section` > `sub-sub-sub-section`
- You don't have to close sections. They will get properly nested and closed
- Text between opening of hierarchy tag and newline gets wrapped in `<header>` tag. `<section> This is the Title` --> `<section> <header>This is the Title</header>`
- Instant closing of certain tags that might get shorthands: `cite`, `aside`, `a`, `ref-sec`, `ref-eq`, `ref-fig`, `ref-table`, `ref-code`
- Example could be `<aside This is the aside and everything here ends up wrapped>` --> `<aside type="footnote">This is the aside and everything here ends up wrapped</aside>`
- Some progress on lists. The goal is that
    ```
    <ol>
    - One
    - Two
    - Three
    </ol>
    ```
  is transformed to
    ```
    <ol>
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>Three</li>
    </ol>
    ```

  That way one could do something like:

    ```
    <ol type="RomanCap">
    - One
    ...
    ...
    ```
- Will need to think about nested lists.

# Example
## Input text:
```
<article> The Article
<section> First Section
text
</section>
<section> Second Section
text <aside this is a note> more text
<sub-section> Sub section
text
<section> Third Section
text
<sub-section> Sub section of another section
text <cite some stuff here>
<sub-section> Another sub section
more text
```

## Output text:
```
<article>
  <header> The Article</header>
  <section>
     <header> First Section</header>
     text
  </section>
  <section>
     <header> Second Section</header>
     text 
     <aside this="" is="" a="" note=""></aside>
     more text
     <sub-section>
        <header> Sub section</header>
        text
     </sub-section>
  </section>
  <section>
     <header> Third Section</header>
     text
     <sub-section>
        <header> Sub section of another section</header>
        text <cite some="" stuff="" here=""></cite>
     </sub-section>
     <sub-section>
        <header> Another sub section</header>
        more text
     </sub-section>
  </section>
</article>
```

# Next Steps
## Citations and cross-refs
Am trying to think about how to directly use code instead of notation for things like cross-references and citations. For instance, maybe it makes sense to do something like:

```
As discussed in section ${getSection("some_section_label", "number:title")}, it's all a crock of stew.
```

to get: 

As discussed in section 3: _Recipes for Life_, it's all a crock of stew.

That's not really much more complicated than 

```
As discussed in section @sec-ref:some_section_label, it's all a crock of stew.
```

And much more declarative.

## Shorthands
Allowing `<#>` --> `<section>`, `<##>` --> `<sub-section>`, etc. would tie right into markdown. I'm thinking that `<b>bold</b>` and `<i>italic<i>` are really not that much harder than markdown. Maybe allow markdown shorthands. I'm thinking math shorthands `<$>, <$$>` in place of `<math-inline>` and `<math-display>`, which will, in turn, get interpreted by a LaTeX engine. For code, I'm thinking about `<``>, <```>`, but really, maybe just do away with the markdown sigils as unnecessary. Makes backticks so annoying. Need a shorthand for executed code and displayed code. `<r-pre>, <py-pre>` vs. `<r-exec>, <py-exec>`. Not sure. And not sure about an inline shorthand like `<js a=10; b=20; console.log(a+b);>` being the same as `` `a=10; b=20; console.log(a+b);` `` and getting transformed to `<js-pre>a=10; b=20; console.log(a+b);</js-pre>`.

The tradeoff is along three dimensions of consistency+function, typing, human readability..

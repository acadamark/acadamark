# academark
Academics oriented markdown variant.

The goal is to include the most important features of a document preparation system for publications:

- [ ] Citations
- [ ] Figure captions
- [ ] Figure numbers
- [ ] References (such as to other sections, equations, figures, ...)
- [ ] Footnotes
- [ ] Equation numbers
- [ ] Section numbers (and hierarchy)
- [ ] Import LaTeX packages, such as for math, chemical formulae, pseudocode, etc.
- [ ] A small to moderate amount of metadata to include packages, specify section
      numbering style, list numbering style, reference format, etc.
- [ ] Another metadata section to put citation data, or in a separate file
- [ ] Inline comments
- [ ] Collaborator specific notes.

Will need to work on this list...

This would not be a substitute for LaTeX. But a sort of very user-friendly, intuitive
subset that renders without compilation. It should be possible to robustly export to LaTeX for
further refinement.

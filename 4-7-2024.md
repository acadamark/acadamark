# Progress!!
With help from chatGPT I make some huge steps. 

https://github.com/abalter/academark-tags

What works:

- Hierarchy of sections `article` > `section` > `sub-section` > `sub-sub-section` > `sub-sub-sub-section`
- You don't have to close sections. They will get properly nested and closed
- Text between opening of hierarchy tag and newline gets wrapped in `<header>` tag. `<section> This is the Title` --> `<section> <header>This is the Title</header>`
- Instant closing of certain tags that might get shorthands: `cite`, `aside`, `a`, `ref-sec`, `ref-eq`, `ref-fig`, `ref-table`, `ref-code`
- Example could be `<aside This is the aside and everything here ends up wrapped>` --> `<aside type="footnote">This is the aside and everything here ends up wrapped</aside>`
- Some progress on lists. The goal is that
    ```
    <ol>
    - One
    - Two
    - Three
    </ol>
    ```
  is transformed to
    ```
    <ol>
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>Three</li>
    </ol>
    ```

  That way one could do something like:

    ```
    <ol type="RomanCap">
    - One
    ...
    ...
    ```
- Will need to think about nested lists.

# Note:
Am trying to think about how to directly use code instead of notation for things like cross-references and citations. For instance, maybe it makes sense to do something like:

```
As discussed in section ${getSection("some_section_label", "number:title")}, it's all a crock of stew.
```

to get: 

As discussed in section 3: _Recipes for Life_, it's all a crock of stew.

That's not really much more complicated than 

```
As discussed in section @sec-ref:some_section_label, it's all a crock of stew.
```

And much more declarative.
